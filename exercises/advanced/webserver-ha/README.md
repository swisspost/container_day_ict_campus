# Webserver HA

In this exercise you are going to deploy your webserver in high-available mode using a reverse proxy in front of it.

## Step 1 - Create a docker network

We haven't talked about [docker networks](https://docs.docker.com/network/) so far, but think of them as separate virtual networks, just as you got multiple subnets in your virtualized environment. They are used to separate multiple containerized apps from each other and have the benefit that containers can directly resolve each other by their hostname (that's why it's important to give them a static name using `--name`).

For this app we are going to create our own network using `docker network create webserver-ha`.

You can find a list of all networks using `docker network ls`.

To start a container in a separate network, run it using the `--net webserver-ha` option.

## Step 2 - Start multiple webservers

Start three new webservers:

- Unique name for everyone
- Same image as in the beginner example (e.g `webserver:latest`)
- **Don't expose the port as it would cause conflicts! Instead, put the container in the created docker network.**
- Run the containers in the `webserver-ha` net

If you have them started, you should see the following in the `docker ps` output:

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE        COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                  PORTS   NAMES
5fb519969a95   webserver    "nginx -g 'daemon of…"   2 seconds ago    Up Less than a second   80/tcp  webserver3
69ce51f3cc2f   webserver    "nginx -g 'daemon of…"   11 seconds ago   Up 9 seconds            80/tcp  webserver2
bfee8d63284b   webserver    "nginx -g 'daemon of…"   20 seconds ago   Up 18 seconds           80/tcp  webserver1
```

## Step 3 - Start a loadbalancer

Now you might noticed that we haven't exposed any ports on these containers to the host. This is because we can't map all of them to port `8080` as port `8080` is unique. Of course we could map them to different ports, but then we would have three different URLs. To distribute the traffic now and expose the service securly we are using a reserve proxy or depending on the layer also called loadbalancer.

If you want to know more about reserve proxies, checkout [this explanation](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/).

We are using [caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) here as reserve proxy since the author of this exercise prefers caddy over nginx or apache, which can both function as reverse proxies too. The config for the reserve proxy is already written, see the [Caddyfile](./Caddyfile) if you are interested.

Now to start the caddy as reverse proxy, run a new container with:

- detached mode
- network: `webserver-ha`
- name `caddy`
- expose port `8080` as `8080` on the host
- mount the `./Caddyfile` into `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` in the container

If the caddy is started, you should be able to browse [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and see a different hostname on every refresh.
