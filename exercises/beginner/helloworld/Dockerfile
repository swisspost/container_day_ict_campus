# Set the maintainer of the dockerfile
#  on older versions the command "MAINTAINER" is used
#  and this is depricated! The new way to set
#  the maintainer is with the "LABEL" (see below)

# Set the working directory inside of the container
# The WORKDIR instruction sets the working directory for any 
#  RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY and ADD instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile.
#  You should use WORKDIR instead of proliferating instructions 
#  like RUN cd â€¦ && do-something, which are hard to read, troubleshoot, and maintain.
WORKDIR /

# Install bash, because the alpine base image is 2MB small and has no bash installed
RUN apk add --no-cache bash

# Copy the bash script into the container at /
#  with ah '.' you can add a whole direcotry to the docker container
COPY script.sh /

# Change the permissions of the script (751=rwx,rx,x)
RUN chmod 751 script.sh

# Run hello_world_bash_script.sh when the container launches
CMD "/script.sh"
